## System requirements

- [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/download)
- [Yarn](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install)

The .nvmrc file in project root describes what Node version to use to make sure we all use the same. To switch between Node versions, a version manager, such as [Node Version Manager (NVM)](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm), is a helpful tool.

## Getting started

```bash
# Install dependencies
yarn install

# Run app in development mode
yarn dev
```

Now you can navigate to the following URL: http://localhost:5173/

## Code style

We use [ESLint](https://eslint.org/) to find issues in the code. You can setup your code editor to highlight such issues, based on the project config. There is also an option to run the following command from terminal:

```bash
# Run linter
yarn lint
```
